## 📌 Project Objective
This project is part of my Data Science internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**. The goal of this task was to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a well-known dataset. I selected the **Titanic dataset** to identify meaningful insights and uncover patterns that contributed to passenger survival outcomes.

---

## 🧠 Key Insights & Deliverables
- Cleaned and preprocessed raw Titanic data
- Handled missing values and encoded categorical features
- Visualized survival patterns based on:
  - Gender
  - Passenger Class
  - Age Group
  - Embarkation Port
- Identified feature correlations influencing survival
- Created informative and aesthetic visualizations using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- **Files Used**: `train.csv`

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- `Python`
- `NumPy`
- `Pandas`
- `Matplotlib`
- `Seaborn`
- `Jupyter Notebook`

---

## 📊 Core Analysis Techniques
- Univariate & Bivariate Analysis
- Data Cleaning (null handling, type casting)
- Encoding Categorical Variables
- Data Visualization (Histograms, Countplots, Boxplots, Heatmaps)

## ✅ Conclusion & Learnings
Through this EDA project, I learned to:
- Draw actionable insights from structured datasets
- Deal with real-world data irregularities (missing values, imbalances)
- Communicate findings through intuitive visualizations
- Understand the significance of data distribution before modeling
